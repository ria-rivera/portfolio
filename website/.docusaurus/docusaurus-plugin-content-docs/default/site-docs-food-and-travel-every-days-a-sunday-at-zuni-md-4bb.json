  "description": "Something has to be said about Sundays and dinners with the family.

Perhaps it's the knowledge that it's the one day of the week when work and school can temporarily be forgotten that makes Sundays something to look forward to. In the Philippines and around the world, Sundays often stand for all things warm, cozy, and delectable.",
