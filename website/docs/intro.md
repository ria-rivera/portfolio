# About

Hello, I'm Ria. Thanks for dropping by!

I'm a Creative Writing major turned Technical Writer who enjoys learning new tools and technologies.

I've been working full-time as a technical writer in the last decade, but I have 20+ years of professional writing and editing experience under my belt. I'm a content expert specializing in technical documentation and UX writing.

Before I focused on technical writing, I was a traveler writer, a tech magazine contributor, and a technical marketing writer.

I'm currently a freelance UX Writer/Technical Writer looking to work with businesses that want to deliver exceptional documentation and user experience. 

How can I help you?
- **Content audit**: Review existing content to identify gaps and areas for improvement.
- **UI review**: Evaluate wireframes or mockups, and recommend user interface strings and error messages.
- **Writing and editing**: I specialize in documentation and UX writing, but I'm open to discussing other writing projects you might have in mind.
