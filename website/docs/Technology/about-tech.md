I have done the full gamut of technical writing: from writing articles for a tech magazine, to doing technical marketing, and eventually focusing on technical documentation and UX writing.

Because of the proprietary nature of software products and the confidentiality agreements I made with the companies I worked for, technical documentation and UX writing samples are only available upon request.
