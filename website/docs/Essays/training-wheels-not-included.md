# Training Wheels Not Included

Most kids get their first bicycles at age 5. I got mine at 30. For the longest time, I was secretly envious of bikers. But after years of not knowing how, I'd resigned myself to the fact that I couldn't ride a bike.

As it turns out, all I needed was a push in the right direction. When I found myself living in a new city where bikes are a primary mode of transportation, I knew things had to change. I became obsessed with the idea of biking. I turned to the Internet for information and found inspiration from others who only learned how to ride as adults. 

One story that particularly stuck with me was that of a 57-year-old man who only recently learned how to ride a bike. He now joins cycling events with his teenage daughter. His story not only inspired me to start learning myself, but it also taught me that I wasn't alone. 

## On balancing acts and facing fears

Armed with a firm resolve to learn, practical tips, and a second-hand bicycle, I set off for a nearby park. When I was first learning how to ride a bike, the one thing I needed to master was how to balance myself on two wheels. Unfortunately, balancing and I had a bad history. I've tried both roller and inline skating and failed. Plus, I almost broke my bones while playing with a skateboard. 

Thankfully, balancing is a skill that can be learned with patience and practice. Once I figured that out, I realized that the real challenge was overcoming my fear. Unlike kids who can laugh even after they fall, us adults worry too much about other people's opinions. Our fears often prevent us from going after the things we truly love just because they defy convention or they're “unacceptable”. I admit that one of the reasons I never bothered to learn was because I did not want to make a fool of myself. After all, there is nothing attractive about crashing into a pole, is there?

## Persistence pays and biking rocks

And crash into a pole I did. When I was first getting the hang of riding, I concentrated too much on staying upright that I panicked when I turned a corner. Instead of gently nudging the handlebars, I shrieked and fell. I completely forgot that I should have pushed the brakes and brought my feet down. 

I was too happy with finally being able to face my fears and learn how to balance that I forgot the other essentials: 1) I need to know where I'm going so I know when to turn, and 2) sometimes we need to stop and reassess things. 

So, that's exactly what I did. I gave biking a break and took the time to catch up on the stuff I've missed, like chores and reading books. By the time the wound had healed, I was ready to take up the challenge again. I knew better the second time around. I knew from experience what worked and what didn't. Despite the fall, I was determined to learn more than ever. 

It definitely did not happen overnight, but after a month or so of persistence, I finally learned how to ride a bike. I thought it was impossible, but I now ride my bike every chance I get. When I ride a bike, a smile automatically spreads on my face. It's actually a bit embarrassing, but I guess you can't blame me. Biking is just awesome. I can't believe I've been missing out on this for so long.
